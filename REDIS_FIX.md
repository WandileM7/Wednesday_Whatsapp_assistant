# Redis Configuration Fix

## Problem
The WAHA (WhatsApp HTTP API) service was failing with Redis connection errors:
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379
[Redis] Connection failed: MaxRetriesPerRequestError
```

## Root Cause
WAHA service deployed on Render was configured to use Redis for session storage, but no Redis service was available in the Render deployment configuration.

## Solution Implemented: Remove Redis Dependency

### Changes Made:
1. **Updated render.yaml** to explicitly disable Redis by setting `REDIS_URL=""` 
2. **Maintained docker-compose.yaml** Redis configuration for local development
3. **WAHA works without Redis** - it will use file-based session storage instead

### Render Configuration:
- **Environment Variable**: `REDIS_URL=""` (explicitly empty)
- **Effect**: WAHA will use file system for session storage instead of Redis
- **Benefit**: No external dependencies, works on Render free tier

## Alternative Solution: Add Redis to Render (Not Recommended for Free Tier)

If Redis is absolutely required, you could:

1. **Add Redis service to render.yaml**:
```yaml
  - type: redis
    name: redis-service
    region: oregon
    plan: starter  # Note: This requires paid plan
```

2. **Update WAHA service to use Redis**:
```yaml
      - key: REDIS_URL
        value: redis://redis-service:6379
```

However, this approach requires a paid Render plan as Redis is not available on the free tier.

## Local Development Usage
```bash
# Start all services (includes Redis)
docker compose up

# Start Redis only
docker compose up redis -d

# Check Redis connection
docker compose exec redis redis-cli ping
```

## Testing the Fix

After deployment, the Redis connection errors should be resolved and WAHA should start successfully without trying to connect to Redis.
