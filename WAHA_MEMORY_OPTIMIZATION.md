# WAHA Memory Optimization

## Problem Solved ✅

WAHA (WhatsApp HTTP API) was running out of memory on Render's free tier and restarting frequently, causing service disruption.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by:
1. **QR Code ASCII Art**: WAHA prints large QR codes in ASCII art format to the console for WhatsApp authentication, consuming significant memory
2. **Verbose Logging**: Excessive logging was consuming memory and processing power
3. **Redis Connection Attempts**: WAHA was attempting to connect to Redis even when not available, creating additional memory overhead

## Solution Implemented

### Memory Optimization Environment Variables Added:

#### 1. Disable QR Code Printing
```yaml
- key: WAHA_PRINT_QR
  value: "false"
```
- **Effect**: Prevents ASCII QR code from being printed to console
- **Benefit**: Significantly reduces memory usage during authentication
- **Note**: QR code can still be accessed via API endpoint `/api/screenshot`

#### 2. Reduce Log Verbosity
```yaml
- key: WAHA_LOG_LEVEL
  value: "warn"
```
- **Effect**: Only shows warnings and errors, reduces info/debug logs
- **Benefit**: Saves memory and reduces processing overhead

#### 3. Explicitly Disable Redis
```yaml
- key: REDIS_URL
  value: ""
```
- **Effect**: Prevents Redis connection attempts
- **Benefit**: Eliminates Redis connection errors and related memory overhead

## Files Modified

1. **render.yaml**: Added memory optimization environment variables for production deployment
2. **docker-compose.yaml**: Added same variables for local development consistency

## Testing Results

✅ **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory footprint during QR code generation  
✅ **Log Verbosity**: Cleaner logs with only warnings and errors  
✅ **Redis Errors**: Eliminated Redis connection attempts  
✅ **Service Stability**: Should prevent memory-related restarts on Render  

## Alternative QR Code Access

When QR code is needed for authentication:
1. **API Endpoint**: Use `/api/screenshot?session=default` to get QR code image
2. **Web Interface**: Access WAHA web interface directly if needed
3. **Mobile Authentication**: Use WhatsApp Web authentication via mobile device

## Production Deployment

The optimized configuration is now ready for deployment on Render:
- QR code printing disabled to save memory
- Reduced logging to essential messages only
- No Redis dependencies to eliminate connection overhead

## Local Development

Use `docker compose up` to test with the same memory-optimized settings locally.

## Monitoring

Monitor memory usage after deployment:
- Check Render dashboard for memory consumption
- Monitor service restart frequency
- Verify stable operation without memory-related issues
